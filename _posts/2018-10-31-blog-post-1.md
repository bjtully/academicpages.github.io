This (first) blog post will be centered on addressing some concerns/questions/irritations that have been raised about our first attempt to bin [metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the Mediterranean Sea](https://peerj.com/articles/3558/). Since their release, these 290 MAGs have caused far more consternation than their [older, more refined siblings](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017203) that has culminated in the following tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi there <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/metagenomics?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#metagenomics</a> people. the fact that someting is binning with something DOES NOT mean it is coming from the same creature!!! it does not..........</p>&mdash; Oded Beja (@BejaLab) <a href="https://twitter.com/BejaLab/status/1053086172476571648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2018</a></blockquote>

This tweet led to a long series of conversations, as ‘metagenomists’ (not a real word at all) detailed various ways that, in fact, current methodologies could be applied to tease apart closely related organisms. While new techniques can, preliminary attempts may be sh\*t. So, it seems like the perfect time to take stock and attempt to fix issues that have persisted in our TMED MAGs.
