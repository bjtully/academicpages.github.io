UPDATING
======
This (first) blog post will be centered on addressing some concerns/questions/irritations that have been raised about our first attempt to bin [metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the Mediterranean Sea](https://peerj.com/articles/3558/). Since their release, these 290 MAGs have caused far more consternation than their [more refined siblings](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017203) that has culminated in the following tweet:

This tweet led to a long series of conversations, as ‘metagenomists’ (not a real word at all) detailed various ways that, in fact, current methodologies could be applied to tease apart closely related organisms. While new techniques can, preliminary attempts may be sh\*t. So, it seems like the perfect time to take stock and attempt to fix issues that have persisted in our TMED MAGs.

290 metagenome-assembled genomes from the Mediterranean Sea – A retrospective
======
In mid-2016, we wanted to know how well our under development binning tool worked on real samples. We began an in-house proof of concept that involved binning the Mediterranean Sea samples from the Tara Oceans metagenomic dataset. These bins were reconstructed based exclusively on variable coverage values and generated, what we thought was impressive, 290 MAGs with >50% estimated completion. We learned some lessons from the process, revamped the [binning tool](https://peerj.com/articles/3035/), incorporating DNA composition metrics to help aid the clustering process, and started the process of binning the entire Tara Oceans metagenomic dataset, repeating the Mediterranean. As it became apparent that this would take a while (1 year+), we had the idea of formally releasing those first 290 MAGs through PeerJ and GenBank. We lovely refer to those MAGs as TMED (Tara-Mediterranean), while the subsequent MAGs are known in the lab as TOBG (Tara Oceans Binned Genomes).
