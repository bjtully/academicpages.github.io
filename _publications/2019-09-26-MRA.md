title: "Genome Sequence of Mariprofundus sp. Strain EBB-1, a Novel Marine Autotroph Isolated from an Iron-Sulfur Mineral"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-09-26-MRA
excerpt: 'Mariprofundus sp. strain EBB-1 was isolated from a pyrrhotite biofilm incubated in seawater from East Boothbay (ME, USA). Strain EBB-1 is an autotrophic member of the class Zetaproteobacteria with the ability to form iron oxide biominerals. Here, we present the 2.88-Mb genome sequence of EBB-1, which contains 2,656 putative protein-coding sequences.'
