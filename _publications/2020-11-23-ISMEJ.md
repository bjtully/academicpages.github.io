title: "Marine Dadabacteria exhibit genome streamlining and phototrophy-driven niche partitioning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-11-23-ISMEJ
excerpt: 'The marine Dadabacteria belong to two clades with apparent distinct ecological niches in global metagenomic data: a clade with the potential for photoheterotrophy through the use of proteorhodopsin, present predominantly in surface waters up to 100 m depth; and a clade lacking the potential for photoheterotrophy that is more abundant in the deep photic zone.'
