title: "Comparative genomics of planktonic Flavobacteriaceae from the Gulf of Maine using metagenomic data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2014-09-05-microbiome
excerpt: 'The Gulf of Maine is an important biological province of the Northwest Atlantic with high productivity year round. From an environmental Sanger-based metagenome, sampled in summer and winter, we were able to assemble and explore the partial environmental genomes of uncultured members of the class Flavobacteria. Each of the environmental genomes represents organisms that compose less than 1% of the total microbial metagenome.'
