title: "Metagenomic analysis of a complex marine planktonic thaumarchaeal community from the Gulf of Maine"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2012-01-01-enviro-micro
excerpt: 'Thaumarchaea, which represent as much as 20% of prokaryotic biomass in the open ocean, have been linked to environmentally relevant biogeochemical processes, such as ammonia oxidation (nitrification) and inorganic carbon fixation. We have used culture-independent methods to study this group because current cultivation limitations have proved a hindrance in studying these organisms.'
