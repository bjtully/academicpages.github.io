Ben Tully is a microbiologist/bioinformatian working in the marine environment. His interests involve studying microbial communities and functions through the tool of metagenomics -- this research has involved the surface ocean, hypersaline lakes, deep-sea oligotrophic sediments, and the subsurface marine aquifer. As part of this research, Tully works to develop new bioinformatic tools that capitalizes on the growing number of environmental microbial genomes. He proudly supports efforts in generating and propagating open data standards and submission to preprint archives.

Tully received his Ph.D. from the University of Southern California in 2013. In 2014, he joined the [Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations](http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/) as their Bioinformatic Specialist. He works with the community to provide the bioinformatic resources required by researchers of the Center and expertise on bioinformatic problems/questions/concerns.
